Solution Needed:
Add a new HE factor that:
Rewards checker distribution across strategic points
Penalizes over-stacking on single points
Values flexibility over rigid positioning
Weights: Maybe 0.15-0.20 in HEURISTIC_WEIGHTS
This is exactly the kind of strategic insight that XG has but current HE lacks! 🎯
Want me to implement a "Positional Balance" factor for the HE system? 🤔
